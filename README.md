Repository for the only Text to Speech Telegram Inline Bot.

This inline bot ([@Txt2SpeechBot](https://t.me/Txt2SpeechBot)) translates your text messages into audios.
It takes the audios from Goole Text To Speech API on a improved way to send them quickly, without downloading them in the VPS.
For more details, you can see the source code.

## Main use

If you want to say "Hello" to somebody, you have to type...

```
@Txt2SpeechBot Hello
```

... in any chat, choose the language and enjoy it :)

Languages are shown in usage order. For example, if the most used language by you is the Spanish, it will be shown the first one.
This is to help you getting a better experience using the bot.
